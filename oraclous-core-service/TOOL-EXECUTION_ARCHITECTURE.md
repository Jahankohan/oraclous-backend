# FINAL UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY
# ===================================

"""
CLARIFICATION: What We Built and Why

You were right to be confused! I initially created two overlapping services which was messy.
Now we have ONE clean, unified service that handles everything.
"""

# ==================== SINGLE SERVICE APPROACH ====================

"""
We now have ONE service: ToolExecutionService

This service handles:
1. Synchronous execution (execute_sync) - for quick operations
2. Asynchronous execution (execute_async) - for long-running operations  
3. Job tracking and progress monitoring
4. Tool capabilities discovery
5. Validation integration
"""

# ==================== CLEAR RESPONSIBILITIES ====================

"""
ToolExecutionService responsibilities:
- Execute tools (both sync and async)
- Track jobs and executions in database
- Stream progress updates for async jobs
- Validate execution readiness
- Resolve credentials during execution
- Update execution statistics

InstanceManagerService responsibilities:
- Manage tool instances (CRUD operations)  
- Handle credential configuration
- Manage instance status transitions
- Create execution records

ValidationService responsibilities:
- Comprehensive readiness validation
- User-friendly error messages
- Actionable error resolution steps

ToolSyncService responsibilities:
- Sync tools from DB to memory on startup
- Handle missing implementations gracefully
"""

# ==================== USAGE FLOW ====================

"""
TYPICAL USAGE FLOW:

1. CREATE INSTANCE:
   POST /api/v1/instances/
   {
     "tool_definition_id": "google-drive-reader",
     "workflow_id": "workflow-123", 
     "name": "My Drive Reader"
   }

2. CONFIGURE CREDENTIALS (if needed):
   POST /api/v1/instances/{id}/configure-credentials
   {
     "credential_mappings": {"OAUTH_TOKEN": "google"}
   }

3. VALIDATE READINESS:
   GET /api/v1/instances/{id}/validate-execution
   Returns: {"is_ready": true/false, "error_message": "...", "action_items": [...]}

4a. EXECUTE SYNCHRONOUSLY (quick operations):
    POST /api/v1/instances/{id}/execute-sync
    {
      "file_id": "abc123",
      "sheet_name": "Data"
    }
    Returns: {"success": true, "data": {...}, "credits_consumed": 0.15}

4b. EXECUTE ASYNCHRONOUSLY (long operations):
    POST /api/v1/instances/{id}/execute-async
    {
      "file_id": "large-file-123", 
      "extract_content": true
    }
    Returns: {"job_id": "job-456", "progress_url": "/api/v1/instances/{id}/jobs/job-456/progress"}

5. TRACK PROGRESS (for async):
   GET /api/v1/instances/{id}/jobs/{job_id}/progress
   Returns: {"status": "RUNNING", "progress": 45, "current_step": "Processing data"}

6. GET RESULT (for async):
   GET /api/v1/instances/{id}/jobs/{job_id}/result  
   Returns: {"status": "COMPLETED", "result": {...}}
"""

# ==================== DATABASE FLOW ====================

"""
DATABASE RECORDS CREATED:

1. ToolInstance (via InstanceManager)
   - Stores instance configuration and credentials
   - Tracks execution statistics

2. Execution (via InstanceManager) 
   - Records each execution attempt
   - Stores input data, output data, timing, credits

3. Job (via ExecutionService)
   - Queues async work
   - Tracks job status and progress
   - Links to execution record
"""

# ==================== ERROR HANDLING IMPROVEMENTS ====================

"""
ENHANCED ERROR MESSAGES:

Old approach:
{
  "error": "OAUTH_TOKEN_INVALID"
}

New approach:
{
  "success": false,
  "error_message": "Your Google account access for Google Drive Reader has expired and needs to be renewed.",
  "metadata": {
    "action_items": [{
      "action": "fix_credential",
      "message": "Click the link below to reconnect your Google account", 
      "url": "https://oauth.example.com/reauth",
      "priority": "high"
    }]
  }
}
"""

# ==================== INTEGRATION STEPS ====================

"""
TO INTEGRATE THIS:

1. REPLACE your existing AsyncToolExecutionService with the new unified ToolExecutionService

2. UPDATE your endpoints to use the unified service (use the artifacts above)

3. ADD the lifespan handler to main.py:
   from app.core.lifespan import lifespan
   app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)

4. TEST the flow:
   - Create instance
   - Execute sync
   - Execute async  
   - Track progress
   - Check validation

5. MISSING PIECE TO FIX:
   The ToolFactory.execute_tool method signature needs to match what we're calling.
   Current call: await ToolFactory.execute_tool(instance, input_data, context)
   Make sure this method exists and works with your tool implementations.
"""

# ==================== WHAT'S DIFFERENT FROM YOUR ORIGINAL ====================

"""
YOUR ORIGINAL AsyncToolExecutionService:
- Only handled async execution
- Job tracking and progress
- Good foundation but limited scope

OUR NEW UNIFIED ToolExecutionService:
- Handles BOTH sync and async execution
- Job tracking and progress (same as yours)
- Tool capabilities discovery
- Enhanced validation with user-friendly messages
- Better error handling
- Integration with validation service

The core job tracking logic is very similar to what you had - I just unified it 
with sync execution and added the capabilities/validation features.
"""

# ==================== NEXT STEPS ====================

"""
IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:

1. Fix ToolFactory.execute_tool method signature
2. Test the sync execution flow
3. Test the async execution flow  
4. Verify job tracking works as expected

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Replace in-memory job storage with Redis
2. Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
3. Implement progress callbacks in tool implementations
4. Add execution result caching
5. Add workflow-level orchestration
