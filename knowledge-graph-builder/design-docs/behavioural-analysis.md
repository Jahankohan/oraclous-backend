Perfect — thanks, that helps a lot. Below I’ve adapted the earlier KG + LLM plan specifically for a **Hogan-style cognitive / scenario assessment for founders** (think HBRI-like business reasoning + scenario-driven behavioral items). I include:

* quick reminders about Hogan (what HBRI measures and that Hogan tools are proprietary) with sources;
* concrete schema additions (nodes/rels) to capture founder behaviours and scenarios;
* prompts you can use to generate scenario items and high-quality distractors with an LLM, plus automatic novelty checks;
* scoring / interpretation approach (how to map responses to traits like risk, ambiguity tolerance, decision style) and cautions about using proprietary instruments;
* example Cypher & FastAPI snippets to store scenario items + responses and compute semantic-match / behavioral indicators;
* a short report template you can generate per-candidate.

I won’t ask any clarifying questions — I’ll make practical recommendations you can implement immediately. If you want code or a notebook for any part, tell me which one and I’ll produce it right away.

# Quick facts about Hogan & HBRI

* The **Hogan Business Reasoning Inventory (HBRI)** measures business/problem-solving reasoning style (qualitative & quantitative/business reasoning) and is offered by Hogan Assessments. It’s one of Hogan’s cognitive tools targeted at workplace decision-making. ([Hogan Assessments][1])
* Hogan’s suite (HPI, HDS, MVPI, HBRI) is a validated, proprietary set of instruments — interpretation and some uses are intended for certified practitioners and there are legal/validity considerations for hiring use. Treat vendor test content and scoring as proprietary. ([Hogan Assessments][2], [gmac.com][3])
* Public descriptions indicate HBRI-style tests are typically short, time-limited (business reasoning items) and mix qualitative/quantitative reasoning problems. (Use this as inspiration for your own scenario tests rather than copying proprietary items.) ([Aptitude-test.com][4], [Personality Test Prep][5])

# Goals (how your KG + LLM should behave for founder-focused scenario testing)

1. **Measure reasoning style** (qualitative vs quantitative emphasis), decision speed, and ability to learn from simulated mistakes.
2. **Measure behavioral tendencies** under founder-like scenarios: risk tolerance, ambiguity tolerance, stakeholder prioritization, bias toward action vs analysis, people-management orientation.
3. **Detect understanding vs memorization** by requiring explanations and using semantic matching to canonical claims/solutions.
4. **Generate transferable items** so candidates who truly understand generalize to new scenarios (transfer tasks).
5. **Produce an interpretable profile** that maps responses to founder-relevant traits and gives concrete growth/fit recommendations.

# Graph schema additions (extend what we discussed earlier)

Add these node types and relationships to capture scenario-driven behavioral items:

Nodes

* `:Scenario` — `{id, title, stem, context_tags, time_pressure_flag, created_at, embedding}`
  (a short business situation deliberately framed like a founder scenario: product, fundraising, hiring, pivot, run rate, burn, user complaint)
* `:BehavioralIndicator` — `{id, name, description, canonical_signals}`
  (e.g. `RiskSeeking`, `AmbiguityTolerance`, `ActionBias`, `StrategicThinking`, `StakeholderEmpathy`)
* `:Trait` — `{id, name, canonical_definition, mapping_to_indicators}` (maps to higher-level constructs you care about)
* `:ScenarioOption` — `{id, text, is_recommended? (nullable), explanation, embedding}`
  (each option for a scenario — can be multiple-choice or ranked options)
* `:Policy` — `{id, name, description}` — optional, for company-specific norms (e.g., "we prioritize cash runway over growth")

Relationships

* `(Scenario)-[:HAS_OPTION]->(ScenarioOption)`
* `(Scenario)-[:TESTS]->(BehavioralIndicator)` (one scenario can signal multiple indicators)
* `(BehavioralIndicator)-[:AGGREGATES_TO]->(Trait)`
* `(Candidate)-[:CHOOSES]->(ScenarioOption)` and `(Response)-[:EVIDENCES]->(BehavioralIndicator)` (link candidate response to inferred indicator with score)
* `(ScenarioOption)-[:IMPLIES]->(Claim)` where `Claim` is an atomic statement used to evaluate explanations.

Why: mapping options to indicators lets you infer behaviors from selections (and from freeform explanations). Keeping canonical signals on `BehavioralIndicator` helps generate explanations and interpretability.

# How to design founder-oriented scenario items

Structure each scenario with the following fields (use these in your LLM prompt/template):

* `Context` (1–2 short sentences): company stage, team size, cash runway, key metric (e.g., MRR, churn), market condition.
* `Dilemma` (1 sentence): the core decision the founder must make.
* `Constraints` (bulleted): time, resources, legal, stakeholder pressures.
* `Options` (4): one **recommended** or “best” option and 3 distractors that each map to a different behavioral indicator (e.g., one is very risk-averse, one is over-optimistic/overinvest, one is defers to others).
* `Scoring rubric`: how each option maps to `BehavioralIndicator` scores and why.
* `Model answer & explanation`: 2–3 claim-level points that a sound explanation should contain.

Examples of scenario topics: fundraising trade-offs (dilution vs runway), hiring leaders vs ICs, pivot vs persevere given early metrics, pricing decision after churn spike, handling a cofounder dispute.

# LLM prompt templates (generate items + distractors + rubrics)

Use a two-step generation: (A) generate candidate scenario item(s), (B) judge/verify & compute embeddings for novelty.

**Item generation prompt (single-shot template)**

> You are a senior startup coach. Produce one founder scenario (stem) for assessing **AmbiguityTolerance** and **RiskTaking**. Output JSON with keys:
>
> * `title`
> * `context` (1–2 sentences)
> * `dilemma` (1 sentence)
> * `constraints` (list)
> * `options` (array of 4 objects `{id, text, behavioral_signal}`) where `behavioral_signal` is one of: `RiskSeeking`, `RiskAverse`, `Cautious_Analytical`, `People_First`.
> * `recommended_option_id` (which best balances short-term survival and long-term strategy)
> * `explanation` (3–5 bullet points explaining why recommended is best)
> * `expected_claims` (list of 3 atomic claims a good explanation should include)

**Distractor-quality checks (judge prompt)**

> For the item below, score each distractor 0–1 on: relevance (does it plausibly address the dilemma?), attractivity (would a plausible founder pick it under stress?), and uniqueness (is it semantically different from others?). Provide a short critique and suggested rewrite for any distractor with score < 0.6.

After generation, embed the stem with your embedder and query your `Question`/`Scenario` index to enforce novelty (reject if cosine similarity > 0.85 to existing items).

# How to infer *how* a candidate is thinking (not just right/wrong)

Combine selection, explanation, and process signals:

1. **Option→Indicator mapping**: each selected option increases the related `BehavioralIndicator` node’s provisional score for that candidate. Use weighted counts (e.g., +1.0 for recommended selection when it indicates `StrategicThinking`, +0.6 for near-best).
2. **Explanation Claim Matching**: extract claims from freeform explanation (LLM IE). For each expected claim present → +score to relevant indicators. If candidate selects option A but explanation contains claims aligned with option B, that suggests *inconsistency* or a change in reasoning (probe further).
3. **Response time & edit history**: fast selection with shallow explanation → candidate relied on heuristic or memorized rule. Slow selection + multi-claim explanation → deliberative reasoning.
4. **Cross-scenario consistency**: cluster a candidate’s indicator vectors across scenarios. E.g., repeated RiskSeeking choices vs only in fundraising scenarios indicates domain-specific risk preference.
5. **Misconception detection via distractor patterns**: if many candidates who pick a certain distractor share similar explanation claims (e.g., “we must scale to show growth”), create a `Misconception` node and link. That drives targeted coaching content.

Quantify: produce a per-candidate vector `V` of behavioral indicators (normalized to \[0,1]) and an uncertainty/confidence score (based on number of items contributing and explanation alignment rate).

# Scoring & psychometrics — practical recipe

* Use classical item stats (p-value, item-total correlation) to find discriminatory items.
* Fit a simple IRT 2PL model if you want latent ability for “strategic reasoning” and discrimination parameters for items (use packages like `pyirt` or `pyro` / `pyMC3` for Bayesian IRT). IRT helps when items vary in difficulty and provides ability estimates robust to sparse data.
* For behavioral indicators, treat them as separate dimensions (multidimensional IRT or a factor-analysis on indicator responses) — that gives you trait-level scores (e.g., `RiskTolerance θ`, `ActionBias θ`).
* Calibrate on a baseline cohort (e.g., 200 founders / managers) to set meaningful norms; otherwise use internal percentiles.

Caveat: Hogan/HBRI have vendor norms and technical manuals — if you intend to claim equivalence to Hogan, you must be careful (Hogan is proprietary). Use your test as an internally validated instrument and be transparent. ([gmac.com][3])

# Example Cypher snippets (store scenario + response + indicator inference)

**Create Scenario with options & indicators**

```cypher
CREATE (s:Scenario {id:$sid, title:$title, stem:$stem, time_pressure:$tp, created_at:datetime()})
WITH s
UNWIND $options AS opt
CREATE (o:ScenarioOption {id:opt.id, text:opt.text, embedding:opt.embedding})
CREATE (s)-[:HAS_OPTION]->(o)
FOREACH (ind IN opt.behavioral_signals |
  MERGE (b:BehavioralIndicator {name:ind})
  MERGE (o)-[:IMPLIES]->(b)
)
RETURN s;
```

**Record response + infer indicators**

```cypher
MATCH (c:Candidate {id:$cid}), (s:Scenario {id:$sid}), (o:ScenarioOption {id:$optid})
CREATE (r:Response {id:$rid, text:$explanation, time:datetime(), time_taken:$time_taken, option_id:$optid})
CREATE (c)-[:GAVE]->(r)-[:RESPONDS_TO]->(s)
CREATE (r)-[:CHOSE]->(o)
WITH r, o
MATCH (o)-[:IMPLIES]->(b:BehavioralIndicator)
MERGE (c)-[ci:HAS_INDICATOR]->(b)
ON CREATE SET ci.score = 0
SET ci.score = ci.score + $weight  // e.g. weight from rubric
RETURN r, collect(b.name) AS inferred_indicators;
```

(You should also update `Response` with explanation-claim matches and similarity scores from vector queries.)

---

# FastAPI flow (outline)

* Endpoint `POST /submit_scenario_response` input: `{candidate_id, scenario_id, chosen_option_id, explanation_text, time_taken}`
* Steps inside:

  1. Compute explanation embedding + extract claims via LLM.
  2. Query `ScenarioOption` embedding to confirm chosen option and compute semantic similarity (defensive check).
  3. Store Response and link to inferred BehavioralIndicators (via the `IMPLIES` edges).
  4. Compare extracted claims to `expected_claims` stored on the `Scenario` node and compute `claim_match_rate`.
  5. Return per-response judgment: `{inferred_indicators_with_scores, claim_match_rate, flags: [low_explanation, possible_memorization, inconsistent_choice]}`

If you want, I can generate the exact FastAPI + Neo4j Python code for this endpoint next.

# Example LLM prompts for extracting claims from freeform explanations

**Claim extraction prompt**

> Extract 3–6 concise atomic claims (short sentences) from this explanation. Number the claims. Do not include speculation.

**Claim-to-indicator mapping prompt (automated)**

> For each extracted claim, list which behavioral indicators it supports from this list: `RiskSeeking, RiskAverse, AmbiguityTolerance, ActionBias, StrategicThinking, PeopleFirst`. Provide confidence 0–1.

Use these to create edges `(Response)-[:SUPPORTS]->(Claim)` and `(Claim)-[:SUPPORTS]->(BehavioralIndicator)`.

---

# Report template (per candidate) — what to surface

1. **Summary** — short paragraph: primary profile (e.g., “Strategic, moderate risk-taking, high action bias”), confidence level and # of scenarios.
2. **Behavioral indicator scores** — bar list of indicators (0–100%) with brief explanation.
3. **Evidence highlights** — 2–3 example scenarios, choices made, matched claims from explanations, and why those choices map to the indicator score.
4. **Consistency & confidence** — how often explanations aligned with choices, response time stats, cross-scenario consistency.
5. **Potential red flags** — e.g., “repeated high risk choices without contingency planning” or “low evidence of learning from mistakes.”
6. **Actionable coaching tips** — targeted next steps or training content (e.g., “run an exercise to formalize risk tradeoffs,” “probe hiring prioritization”).

---

# Practical safeguards & ethics

* **Do not present your instrument as “Hogan” or claim equivalence** — Hogan is proprietary. Use public language (e.g., “inspired by business reasoning tests”) and document validation efforts. ([gmac.com][3])
* **Consent & fairness** — collect candidate consent, log usage, and check for adverse impact across groups. Calibrate items and review bias before using for selection decisions.
* **Transparency** — show candidates their profile and reasoning examples where possible; enable human review.

# Quick wins you can implement in the next hour

1. Add `:Scenario` and `:ScenarioOption` nodes and a `BehavioralIndicator` set to your KG.
2. Create the LLM prompt templates above and add an automated novelty check against `Scenario` embeddings.
3. Add an endpoint `POST /submit_scenario_response` following the FastAPI flow and start capturing explanations.
4. Run a quick pilot with 20–50 founders, compute simple indicator vectors, and inspect item p-values and explanation match rates.

---

If you want, I can **immediately** produce one of the following (pick one and I’ll create it now — no waiting):

* A set of **10 ready-to-run founder scenario items** (JSON) with options, recommended answers, expected claims, and behavioral mappings (I’ll run them through novelty checks against any existing items you paste).
* Full **FastAPI + Neo4j** endpoint code to store scenario items & responses (complete with the Cypher above wired in).
* A small **analysis notebook** (Python) that takes a CSV of scenario responses and computes per-item p-values, discrimination, per-candidate indicator vectors, and a short PDF report per candidate.

Which of those do you want first?
