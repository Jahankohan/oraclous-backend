# Knowledge Graph Builder - Next Steps Backlog

## 🎯 **Current Status: ~80% Complete**
✅ **Completed:** Entity extraction, schema evolution, embeddings, search, chat, background jobs  
🔄 **In Progress:** Advanced graph intelligence system  
❌ **Missing:** Orchestrator integration, analytics dashboard, production polish

---

## 🔴 **Priority 1: Critical Quality Fixes (Week 1-2)**

### **Issue #1: Chat Hallucination Prevention** 
**Status:** 🚀 **SOLUTION READY** - Advanced Graph Context System
- **Action:** Deploy advanced chat service with graph-based reasoning
- **Files:** `advanced_graph_context.py`, `enhanced_chat_service.py`, updated `chat.py`
- **Test:** Verify responses only use graph data, never external knowledge
- **Impact:** ⚠️ **Critical** - Prevents misinformation, ensures trustworthiness

### **Issue #2: Enhanced Graph Modeling** 
**Status:** 📋 **Next Implementation**
- **Problem:** Job titles stored as node properties instead of relationship properties
- **Solution:** Relationship-focused extraction rules + property categorization
- **Files:** Update `entity_extractor.py` extraction logic
- **Example:** `Person -[:WORKS_FOR {position: "CEO", start_date: "2019"}]-> Company`
- **Impact:** 🟡 **High** - Better graph queries and relationship modeling

## 🟡 **Priority 2: Enhanced Data Processing (Week 3-4)**

### **Issue #3: Multi-Modal Extraction Pipelines**
**Status:** 🔧 **Design Phase**
- **Current:** Single text extraction pipeline
- **Needed:** Specialized extractors for different data types
- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  class ExtractionPipelineFactory:
      @staticmethod
      def get_extractor(data_type: str):
          if data_type == "raw_text": return TextEntityExtractor()
          elif data_type == "tabular": return TableEntityExtractor() 
          elif data_type == "qa_pairs": return QAEntityExtractor()
          elif data_type == "relational": return RelationalEntityExtractor()
  ```
- **Files:** New pipeline classes, updated ingestion endpoints
- **Impact:** 🔵 **Medium** - Supports diverse data sources

### **Issue #4: User Context & Instructions System**
**Status:** 🔧 **Design Phase**
- **Solution:** Pre-ingestion context gathering system
- **Features:**
  - Data context input ("employee data", "research papers")
  - Purpose specification ("HR analytics", "literature review")
  - Graph modeling preferences (temporal, hierarchical, relationship-focused)
  - Custom extraction instructions
- **Files:** New request models, updated ingestion workflow
- **Impact:** 🔵 **Medium** - Better quality graphs through user guidance

---

## 🟢 **Priority 3: User Experience Enhancements (Week 5-6)**

### **Issue #5: Real-time Progress & Streaming**
**Status:** 🚀 **SOLUTION READY** - WebSocket endpoints included in advanced chat
- **Background Jobs:** WebSocket progress streaming for ingestion
- **Chat Streaming:** Token-by-token response streaming (implemented)
- **Files:** WebSocket endpoints in updated `chat.py`, background job updates
- **Impact:** 🟢 **Nice-to-have** - Better user experience

---

## 📊 **Priority 4: Production Features (Week 7-8)**

### **Orchestrator Integration**
- **Status:** ❌ **Missing** - Register as tool in oraclous-core
- **Impact:** 🔴 **Critical** - Enables workflow integration
- **Effort:** 1-2 weeks

### **Analytics Dashboard** 
- **Status:** ❌ **Missing** - Graph metrics, community detection, centrality analysis
- **Impact:** 🟡 **High** - User insights and graph exploration
- **Effort:** 2-3 weeks

### **Performance & Monitoring**
- **Status:** ⚠️ **Basic** - Need comprehensive monitoring and optimization
- **Impact:** 🟡 **High** - Production readiness
- **Effort:** 1-2 weeks

🧪 Test: Verify job titles on relationships, not nodes
```

### **Sprint 3 (Week 3): User Context System**
```bash
✅ Priority: MEDIUM
📁 Files: New request models, ingestion workflow
🎯 Goal: Pre-ingestion instructions and preferences
⏱️ Effort: 5-7 days  
🧪 Test: Custom instructions improve graph quality
```

### **Sprint 4 (Week 4): Multi-Modal Pipelines**
```bash
✅ Priority: MEDIUM
📁 Files: New extractor classes, pipeline factory

## 🚨 **Risk Mitigation**

### **High Risk Items**
1. **Graph Algorithm Performance** - Community detection and PageRank on large graphs
   - *Mitigation*: Implement caching, limit to smaller graphs initially
   
2. **WebSocket Scalability** - Many concurrent streaming connections  
   - *Mitigation*: Connection limits, Redis for state management

3. **LLM API Costs** - Advanced reasoning uses more tokens
   - *Mitigation*: Token limiting, caching, user quotas

### **Dependencies**
- **Neo4j Graph Data Science Library** - Required for community detection, PageRank
- **WebSocket Infrastructure** - May need Redis for scaling  
- **LLM Provider Stability** - OpenAI API reliability for advanced reasoning
