# API Directory

## 1. Overview
This directory contains API routing logic and dependencies for the knowledge graph builder. It organizes endpoints, manages dependency injection, and provides versioned API routers.

## 2. Modules & Services

### dependencies.py
- **Functionality:** Provides shared dependencies (e.g., DB session, auth) for endpoints.
- **Connections:** Used by endpoint routers for dependency injection.
- **Risks:** Tight coupling if dependency logic changes.

### v1/
- **Functionality:** Contains version 1 API router and endpoints.
- **Connections:** Main entry point for API requests.
- **Risks:** Versioning logic must be maintained as API evolves.

### __init__.py
- **Functionality:** Package initializer.

### __pycache__/
- **Functionality:** Python bytecode cache; not relevant for documentation.

## 3. Interconnections
- Endpoints call services and use models/schemas for validation.
- Dependencies inject shared resources into endpoints.

## 4. Example Flow
```
api/v1/endpoints/chat.py -> services/chat_service.py -> models/chat.py
api/v1/endpoints/graph.py -> services/graph_service.py -> models/graph.py
```

## 5. Notes
- **Tight Coupling:** Endpoints are tightly coupled to service and schema logic.
- **Risks:** Dependency changes can break endpoints.
- **Assumptions:** Dependency injection is properly configured.

## 6. Refactoring Ideas
- Use FastAPI's dependency overrides for testing.
- Modularize endpoint logic for easier versioning.
- Automate OpenAPI documentation generation.
