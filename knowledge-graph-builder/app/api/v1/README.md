# API v1 Directory

## 1. Overview
This directory contains the version 1 API router and endpoint definitions for the knowledge graph builder. It organizes endpoints by domain and connects them to service logic.

## 2. Modules & Services

### router.py
- **Functionality:** Main API router for v1 endpoints.
- **Connections:** Imports and registers endpoint modules.
- **Risks:** Tight coupling to endpoint structure; changes require updates.

### endpoints/
- **Functionality:** Contains individual endpoint modules (e.g., chat, graph, extract).
- **Connections:** Each endpoint calls relevant services and uses models/schemas.
- **Risks:** Endpoint logic must be kept in sync with service and schema changes.

### __pycache__/
- **Functionality:** Python bytecode cache; not relevant for documentation.

## 3. Interconnections
- Endpoints call services and use models/schemas for validation.
- Router aggregates endpoints for API exposure.

## 4. Example Flow
```
v1/endpoints/chat.py -> services/chat_service.py -> models/chat.py
v1/endpoints/graph.py -> services/graph_service.py -> models/graph.py
```

## 5. Notes
- **Tight Coupling:** Endpoints are tightly coupled to service and schema logic.
- **Risks:** Router changes can break endpoint registration.
- **Assumptions:** Endpoints are properly registered and versioned.

## 6. Refactoring Ideas
- Modularize endpoint logic for easier versioning and testing.
- Automate endpoint registration.
- Add endpoint health checks and monitoring.
