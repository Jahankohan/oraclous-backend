# Schemas Directory

## 1. Overview
This directory contains Pydantic schemas for request/response validation, serialization, and documentation. Schemas are used by endpoints and services to ensure data integrity and provide OpenAPI docs.

## 2. Modules & Services

### graph_schemas.py
- **Functionality:** Defines Pydantic schemas for graph-related requests and responses.
- **Connections:** Used by graph endpoints and services for validation.
- **Risks:** Schema changes require updates in endpoints and services.

### __pycache__/
- **Functionality:** Python bytecode cache; not relevant for documentation.

## 3. Interconnections
- Used by endpoints for request/response validation.
- Used by services for data integrity.

## 4. Example Flow
```
api/v1/endpoints/graph.py -> schemas/graph_schemas.py -> services/graph_service.py
```

## 5. Notes
- **Tight Coupling:** Schemas are tightly coupled to models and endpoints.
- **Risks:** Schema evolution requires coordinated updates.
- **Assumptions:** Schemas match models and API contracts.

## 6. Refactoring Ideas
- Automate schema generation from models.
- Add schema versioning for backward compatibility.
- Decouple schemas from models using mapping functions.
