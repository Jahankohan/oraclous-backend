# Models Directory

## 1. Overview
This directory defines the core data structures for the knowledge graph builder, including graph nodes, edges, and chat objects. Models are used throughout services and endpoints for data validation, serialization, and database interaction.

## 2. Modules & Services

### chat.py
- **Functionality:** Defines chat message and session models.
- **Connections:** Used by chat services and endpoints.
- **Risks:** Schema changes require updates in chat logic.

### graph.py
- **Functionality:** Defines graph node, edge, and relationship models.
- **Connections:** Used by graph services and Neo4j client.
- **Risks:** **Tight coupling** to graph schema; DB schema changes require code updates.

### __init__.py
- **Functionality:** Package initializer.

### __pycache__/
- **Functionality:** Python bytecode cache; not relevant for documentation.

## 3. Interconnections
- Used by services for data validation and serialization.
- Graph models are central for DB operations.

## 4. Example Flow
```
api/v1/endpoints/graph.py -> graph_service.py -> models/graph.py
api/v1/endpoints/chat.py -> chat_service.py -> models/chat.py
```

## 5. Notes
- **Tight Coupling:** Models are tightly coupled to DB schema.
- **Risks:** Schema evolution requires coordinated updates.
- **Assumptions:** Models match DB schema.

## 6. Refactoring Ideas
- Use Pydantic or dataclasses for validation and serialization.
- Add versioning to models for schema evolution.
- Decouple models from DB schema using mapping layers.
